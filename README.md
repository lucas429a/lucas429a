I'm a developer graduated from Kenzie Academy Brasil, I've been studying for over 3 years and have more than a year of experience working at a company developing robust and scalable solutions.

Throughout my journey, I've developed expertise in architectures such as SOLID, Clean Architecture, DDD e TDD, always seeking clean and maintainable code.

I work with modern technologies in frontend and backend, using TS and Python and frameworks like React, Django and Node, always focused on delivering value through quality software.
